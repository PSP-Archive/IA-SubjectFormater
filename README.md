# IA-SubjectFormater
Basic script to append universal tags to homebrew.


### Usage Example
```python
python3 main.py
```
## Notice
Since this script appends to the main tags of the collection, please keep an eye out when its working in case something goes wrong, so the damage is minimized.
When this script is running and the IA goes down while it runs(it did happen) some tags break, I am not responsible for any damage to tags.


This will probably only work on Linux because of the subproccess module
