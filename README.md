# IA-SubjectFormater
Basic script to append universal tags to homebrew.


### Usage Example
```python
python3 main.py
```
## Notice
Since this script appends to the main tags of the collection, please keep an eye out when its working, in case something goes wrong so the damage is minimized.
This will probably only work on Linux because of the subproccess module
